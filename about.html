<h1>About this blog</h1>

<p>
I started this blog because I had written out some examples and notes about neural networks while refreshing their theory and implementation issues. Since these are written in IPython notebook files it was only a small step to publish them on Github Pages via Jekyll so that these notes might be of benefit to others.
