This is a compilation of interesting papers and articles.

## Neural networks

* ["On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning"](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/momentum.pdf) describes momentum and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient and makes the link between momentum and Hessian Free methods. The paper shows the importance of momentum based methods together with careful initialization on deep autoencoders and recurrent neural networks.
